8. ### Blocktext

>blocktext example

9. ### Code Blocks

We can start code blocks by putting the code between ``` and then mentioning the language in the codeblock.

``` Java

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}

```

10. ### Table 


To add a **table**, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

* #### Alignment in table 

You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (:) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Left      | Centre       | Here's right   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |
